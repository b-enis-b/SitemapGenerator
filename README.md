# SitemapGenerator

### Purpose

SitemapGenerator scans all internal links within a website and checks for broken links, creating sitemaps in the process. It also allows you to set a limit on the number of URLs in a file, splitting sitemap files accordingly, and generates a sitemap index file.

### How to Use It

Enter the full URL of the web page you want to scan, like 'https://example.com', in the URL section. Then, after specifying the maximum number of links to be included in an XML file, start the process.
